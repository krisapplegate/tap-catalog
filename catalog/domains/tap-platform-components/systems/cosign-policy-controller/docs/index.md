# Supply Chain Security Tools for VMware Tanzu - Policy Controller 

Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy Controller is a security tool that helps
operators ensure that the container images in their registry have not been
tampered with. Policy Controller is a Kubernetes Admission Controller that
allows operators to apply policies to verify signatures on container images
before being admitted to a cluster.

The Policy Controller:

* Verifies signatures on container images used by Kubernetes resources
* Enforces policies to allow or deny images being admitted a cluster
* Allows operators to define multiple policies in the cluster
* Allows operators to select which `namespaces` to enforce policies against
* Supports `cosign` signatures and keyless signing
* Supports storing public keys in a KMS

It enforces its policies against all resources that create `Pod`s as part of their life cycle:

* `Pod`
* `ReplicaSet`
* `Deployment`
* `Job`
* `StatefulSet`
* `DaemonSet`
* `CronJob`

>**Note:** This component is the successor to `Supply Chain Security Tools - Sign`, which is deprecated. Support and maintenance for `Supply Chain Security Tools - Sign` continues. Monitor Release Notes for updates.

Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy Controller is based on Sigstore's Policy Controller and is compatible only with `cosign` signatures. See 
[Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) and
[Policy Controller](https://github.com/sigstore/policy-controller) in GitHub. For information about image signing and verification, see [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) open source community and the [cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview) project in GitHub. 

The Policy Controller component is a policy enforcement tool only. It does not sign images. Operators can configure image signing for their containers in several ways, including:

* By using Tanzu Build Service
* By using [kpack](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack/blob/main/docs/tutorial.md) 
* By integrating [cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview) into their build pipelines

Image signatures generated by `cosign` are stored in the same registry location as the image itself unless configured with the `COSIGN_REPOSITORY` environment variable. Policy Controller uses registry credentials provided in the admission request, Service Account, or `signaturePullSecrets` defined in the policy to connect to the registry to verify a signature.
