# Upgrading Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

This document describes how to upgrade Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan from the Tanzu Application Platform package repository.

You can perform a fresh install of Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan by following the instructions in [Install Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan](install-scst-scan.md).

This topic includes instructions for:

1. [Prerequisites](#prereqs)

2. [General Upgrades for Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan](#general-upgrades)

3. Upgrading to:
   - [Version v1.2.0](#upgrade-to-1-2-0)


## <a id="prereqs"></a> Prerequisites

Before you upgrade Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan:

* Upgrade the Tanzu Application Platform by following the instructions in [Upgrading Tanzu Application Platform](../upgrading.md)

## <a id="general-upgrades"></a> General Upgrades for Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

When you're upgrading to any version of Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan these are some factors to accomplish this task successfully:

1. Inspect the [Release Notes](../release-notes.md) for the version you're upgrading to. There you can find any breaking changes for the installation.
1. Get the values schema for the package version you're upgrading to by running:

  ```console
  tanzu package available get scanning.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/$VERSION --values-schema -n tap-install
  ```

   Where `$VERSION` is the new version. This gives you insights on the values you can configure in
   your `tap-values.yaml` for the new version.

## <a id="upgrade-to-1-2-0"></a> Upgrading to Version v1.2.0

If you're upgrading from a previous version of Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan to the version `v1.2.0`, do the following:

1. Change the `SecretExports` from Supply Chain Security Tools - Store.

  Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan needs information to connect to the Supply Chain Security Tools - Store deployment, you must change where these secrets are exported to enable the connection with the version `v1.2.0` of Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan.

  **Single Cluster Deployment**

  Edit the `tap-values.yaml` file you used to deploy Supply Chain Security Tools - Store to export the ca secret to your developer namespace.

  ```yaml
  metadata_store:
      ns_for_export_app_cert: "<DEV-NAMESPACE>"
  ```

  >**Note:** The `ns_for_export_app_cert` currently supports only one namespace at a time. If you have multiple namespaces you can replace this value with a `"*"`, but this is discourage due to security reasons.

  Update Tanzu Application Platform to apply the changes:

  ```console
  tanzu package installed update tap -f tap-values.yaml -n tap-install
  ```

  **Multi-Cluster Deployment**

  You must reapply the SecretExport by changing the toNamespace: scan-link-system to Namespace: `DEV-NAMESPACE`

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: secretgen.carvel.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: SecretExport
    metadata:
      name: store-ca-cert
      namespace: metadata-store-secrets
    spec:
      toNamespace: "<DEV-NAMESPACE>"
    ---
    apiVersion: secretgen.carvel.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: SecretExport
    metadata:
      name: store-auth-token
      namespace: metadata-store-secrets
    spec:
      toNamespace: "<DEV-NAMESPACE>"
    ```

2. Update your `tap-values.yaml` file.

  The installation of the Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan and the Grype scanner have some changes. The connection to the Supply Chain Security Tools - Store component have moved to the Grype scanner package. To deactivate the connection from the Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan, which is still present for backwards compatibility, but is deprecated and is removed in `v1.3.0`.

    ```yaml
    # Disable scan controller embedded Supply Chain Security Tools - Store integration
    scanning:
      metadataStore:
        url: ""

    # Install Grype Scanner v1.2.0
    grype:
      namespace: "<DEV-NAMESPACE>" # The developer namespace where the ScanTemplates are gonna be deployed
      metadataStore:
        url: "<METADATA-STORE-URL>" # The base URL where the Store deployment can be reached
        caSecret:
          name: "<CA-SECRET-NAME>" # The name of the secret containing the ca.crt
          importFromNamespace: "<SECRET-NAMESPACE>" # The namespace where Store is deployed (if single cluster) or where the connection secrets were created (if multi-cluster)
        authSecret:
          name: "<TOKEN-SECRET-NAME>" # The name of the secret containing the auth token to connect to Store
          importFromNamespace: "<SECRET-NAMESPACE>" # The namespace where the connection secrets were created (if multi-cluster)
    ```

  For more insights on how to install Grype, see [Install Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan (Grype Scanner)](install-scst-scan.md#install-grype).

  Note: If a mix of Grype templates (`<v1.2.0` and `â‰¥v1.2.0`) are used, both `scanning` and `grype` need to configure the parameters, and the secret needs to export to both scan-link-system and the dev namespace (either by exporting to "*" or by defining multiple secrets and exports. (similarly if grype is installed to multiple namespaces there must be corresponding exports). See [Install Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan (Grype Scanner)](install-scst-scan.md#install-grype)

  Now update Tanzu Application Platform to apply the changes:

  ```console
  tanzu package installed update tap -f tap-values.yaml -n tap-install
  ```

3. Update the `ScanPolicy` to include the latest structure changes for `v1.2.0`.

  To update to the latest valid Rego File in the `ScanPolicy`, [Enforce compliance policy using Open Policy Agent](policies.md). `v1.2.0` introduced some breaking changes in the Rego File structure used for the `ScanPolicies`, See the [Release Notes](../release-notes.md#scst-scan-changes).

4. Verify the upgrade.

  You can run any `ImageScan` or `SourceScan` in your `<DEV-NAMESPACE>` where the Grype Scanner was installed, and it finishes successfully. Here is a sample you can try to run to detect if everything upgraded successfully.

  Create the `verify-upgrade.yaml` file in your system with the following content:

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: scanning.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
    kind: ScanPolicy
    metadata:
      name: scanpolicy-sample
    spec:
      regoFile: |
        package main

        # Accepted Values: "Critical", "High", "Medium", "Low", "Negligible", "UnknownSeverity"
        notAllowedSeverities := ["Critical", "High"]
        ignoreCves := []

        contains(array, elem) = true {
          array[_] = elem
        } else = false { true }

        isSafe(match) {
          severities := { e | e := match.ratings.rating.severity } | { e | e := match.ratings.rating[_].severity }
          some i
          fails := contains(notAllowedSeverities, severities[i])
          not fails
        }

        isSafe(match) {
          ignore := contains(ignoreCves, match.id)
          ignore
        }

        deny[msg] {
          comps := { e | e := input.bom.components.component } | { e | e := input.bom.components.component[_] }
          some i
          comp := comps[i]
          vulns := { e | e := comp.vulnerabilities.vulnerability } | { e | e := comp.vulnerabilities.vulnerability[_] }
          some j
          vuln := vulns[j]
          ratings := { e | e := vuln.ratings.rating.severity } | { e | e := vuln.ratings.rating[_].severity }
          not isSafe(vuln)
          msg = sprintf("CVE %s %s %s", [comp.name, vuln.id, ratings])
        }
    ---
    apiVersion: scanning.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
    kind: ImageScan
    metadata:
      name: sample-public-image-scan
    spec:
      registry:
        image: "nginx:1.16"
      scanTemplate: public-image-scan-template
      scanPolicy: scanpolicy-sample
    ```

  Deploy the resources

  ```console
  kubectl apply -f verify-upgrade.yaml -n <DEV-NAMESPACE>
  ```

  View the scan results

  ```console
  kubectl describe imagescan sample-public-image-scan -n <DEV-NAMESPACE>
  ```

  If it is successful, the `ImageScan` goes to the `Failed` phase and shows the results of the scan in the `Status`.
